# DDoS-attacks
A machine learning-based ensemble model for securing the IoT network
The rapidly growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a rise in data transfers, which has raised security concerns. Due to the devices limited processing capabilities and vulnerability to many Cyber attacks, securing IoT communication is challenging. Security threats mainly Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks take a toll on the network in the form of increased communication overhead. This paper is about detection of DDoS attacks using a machine learning based ensemble model with the help of Software Defined Networking (SDN). The model uses various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR) , K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) , Naive Bayes (NB) , Extra-Tree (ET) , Decision Tree Classifier (DT) and XGBoost (XGB). Various metrics including Accuracy,F1,precision and recall were used to evaluate the model performance. The ensemble method with stacking classifier proved a classification accuracy of 99.98%.

The dataset used in this paper is developed in mininet emulator. The mininet framework creates 10 topologies with switches coupled to ryu controller. The network simulation includes benign traffic like TCP, UDP and ICMP , as well as malicious traffic including TCP syn attacks, UDP flood attacks, and ICMP attacks.
